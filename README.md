# DataProcessing-master

This is a MATLAB repository for codes related to my muscusloskeletal modelling pipeline.
It includes an overall set of code to handle biomechanical data (e.g. motion capture, electromyography, force platforms, and analog signals aquired) and process the data using OpenSim custom build functions.

The repository also contains specific code designed for specific project needs.
