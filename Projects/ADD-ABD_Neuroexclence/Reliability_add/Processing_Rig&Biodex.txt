When testin reliability of strenght measures follow these steps:

1. Convert C3D2MAT and dat2mat

2. Call function 'ForceRig' 

    This function get the maximum torque for condition and the individual maximum for each trial

3. Call 

4. Call 'plotIntraCV.m'
   
    This funtion is used to calculate and plot the intra individual CV for a given data set.
    The data set should be a NxM DOUBLE 

    N (row) = each particpant
    M (columns) = different trials paired per condition.

    When calling 'plotIntraCV.m' :

        1 - call 'CVtables.m' to create a table with the intra-individual CV 

            1.1 - call 'orgCV' to organize the raw double into a 2xN Cell Matrix

            1.2 - loop through every condition (each cell) and calls 'intraCV.m' to
                  calculate the mean and CI of the intra-individual CV.
