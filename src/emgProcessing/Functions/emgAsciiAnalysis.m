%Function to import .c3d file and .txt file and move downsampled EMG into
%the .c3d file
%   Import .c3d and .txt file, load the acquisition using btk, downsample
%   the EMG data so it fits with mocap data, then import the EMG into the
%   appropriate EMG column - also rename the EMG column.

%% Load c3d file using btk and add EMG data from text file.
% EMG data comes in form of text file
% Convert the text file to column variables and insert into c3d file as
% single analog channels for each muscle.

% The channels used in the normal EMG data are as follows
% Channel1 = Tib Ant
% Channel3 = Med Gastroc
% Channel4 = Lat Gastroc
% Channel6 = Biceps Fem
% Channel7 = VM
% Channel8 = VL
% Channel9 = RF
% Channel10 = Soleus
% Channel11 = Medial Ham

%% Import the .txt file and store in relevant column vectors
% Imports the data as 45000 x 1 column vectors for each muscle
% May need to resample the data to fit into c3d file
% Need to remember that the EMG data needs to align with the beginning of
% the c3d file so that the timing matches.

% Make this process faster by first searching the folder for names of
% files, and creating a cell array with those names for the .txt files and
% those for .c3d files

% Do this for fast and slow walks, and KneeFJC1 and 2
