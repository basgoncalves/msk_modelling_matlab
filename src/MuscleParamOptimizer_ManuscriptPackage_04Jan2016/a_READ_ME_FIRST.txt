GENERAL DESCRIPTION
---------------------

This Matlab package is made available as accompanying material of the publication: Modenese, L., Ceseracciu, 
E., Reggiani, M. and Lloyd, D. G., Estimation of musculotendon parameters for scaled and subject specific 
musculoskeletal models using an optimization technique. Journal of Biomechanics (2016, in press).

-------------
REQUIREMENTS
-------------
This package requires to have installed the OpenSim 3.2 API for Matlab.
See how to install it at http://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8080/display/OpenSim/Scripting+with+Matlab

CONTENTS
---------

Following the alphabetic order of the scripts in the main folder, it is possible
to reproduce exactly the results used in the manuscript (scripts a and b) as well as
the Figures (scripts c-d-e).

The modified generic models and the subject specific model derived from the LHDL 
dataset can be found in folder Example#>MSK_Models.

Reproducing the sensitivity study can be time-consuming, depending on the available
computational resources.
