1. a bit slow to install and open (maybe in python or Go)? 
With Chat GPT or somehelp from a computer scientist
	
2. Intead of working directory write "Data folder" or "Folder containing MRI data" ...
	
3. Checking PyMeshLab opens in python, you can probably just check and make sugestions.
	a. add my code to auto pip install  

		import subprocess
		import sys
		import pkg_resources

		Packages = ["pymeshlab"]

		installed_packages = pkg_resources.working_set
		installed_packages_list = sorted(["%s==%s" % (i.key, i.version) for i in installed_packages])


		for pkg in Packages:
			if any(pkg in s for s in installed_packages_list):
				print(pkg + " already installed")
			else:
				subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", pkg])


		f = open('testPyMeshLabResult.txt', 'w')

		try:
			import pymeshlab
		except:
		   print('PyMeshLab not installed or linked correctly with python')
		   f.write('not working')
		else:
		   print('PyMeshLab working correctly')
		   f.write('working')
		finally:
			f.close()
			

4. add a cancel button or someting when checking pymeshlab. It crashed and I need to turn off 
the whole prgramm

5. Permission denied! Give permisison to write on folder

6. Run cubit check after path selection

7. Workout the VSCode issue

8. add a 'typically' to FEbio step install

9. in the 'analysis' and 'loading' steps, would be cool to add labels to the events when asking 
if they are correct. See slide 26 example

10. on Plots add the x and y labels (units)
