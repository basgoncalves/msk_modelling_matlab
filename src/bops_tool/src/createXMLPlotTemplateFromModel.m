% Function to create the XML Template required by PlotStorage.m function  %
%                (which plots results stored in .sto files).              %
% It allows to define groups for the muscles in the .osim model: results  %
% from muscles belonging to the same group will be plotted in the same    %
%                                 figure.                                 %

function []=createXMLPlotTemplateFromModel(osim_file, path)
% Inputs:
%   osim_file: full path + name of the .osim model
%   path: where to store the output XML template file
% Output:
%   a XML template with a single group including all muscles of the
%   input model. Starting from this file, users can define their own muscle
%   groups to plot the results with the PlotStorage.m function.
